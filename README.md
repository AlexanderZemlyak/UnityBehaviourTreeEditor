## Overview
This repository is a Unity project which contains the Behaviour Tree Editor package.

The package and documentation is located in this repository here: https://github.com/thekiwicoder0/UnityBehaviourTreeEditor/tree/main/Assets/BehaviourTree

## Installation

### Package Manager

The easiest way to install the package is directly from Package Manager in Unity via the `Add Package From git URL` using the following url:

### Custom Package

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and create a .unitypackage file manually by running the `Export Package` command on the `Behaviour Tree` folder within Unity.

The exported package can then be installed into your project using the `Assets->Import Package->Custom Package` command.
